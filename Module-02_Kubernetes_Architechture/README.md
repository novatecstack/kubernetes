## Kubernetes Cluster Components
   - Control Plain Components
     - api-server
     - controller
     - scheduler
     - etcd
   - Data Plain Components
     - kube-proxy
     - kubelet

## What are K8s Control Plane Components?
   - The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster.
   - The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling).
   - The control plane is responsible for detecting and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new pod when a deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied).
   - The control plane consists of the manager nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Some of the Control plain components are: kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, etcd, kube-controller-manager

## What are *Nodes* or *Worker Nodes*?
   - A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called <b>*nodes*</b>, that run containerized applications.
   - Every cluster has at least one <b>*worker node*</b>.
   - The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload.

## What are K8s Node components?
   - Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.
   - Some of the K8s node components are as follows: kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime.

## [What are K8s Addons?](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/)
   - Addons use Kubernetes resources to implement cluster features.
   - Because these are providing cluster-level features, namespaced resources for addons belong within the kube-system namespace.
   - Some of the addons are as follows: Web UI (Dashboard), DNS, Container resource monitoring
