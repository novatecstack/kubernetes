# Kubernetes Objects

  - Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. 
  - Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. 
    - Specifically, they can describe:
    - What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes)
    - The resources available to those applications
    - The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance
