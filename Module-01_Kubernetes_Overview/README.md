# 1. Introduction to Kubernetes
  - Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
  - It was developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). 
  - Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is becoming the de-facto standard for container orchestration due to its numerous benefits.

## 1.1 Docker vs Kubernetes
   | Docker  | Kubernetes |
   | ------------- | ------------- |
   | 1. Docker is a containerization platform that allows us to package applications along with all the dependencies and libraries required to run them  | 1. Kubernetes is designed to manage containerized applications at scale.  |
   | 2. Docker containers are lightweight and can be deployed on any platform. | 2. Kubernetes is a cluster (group of nodes) that work together to run and manage containers  |
   | 3. Docker only allows you to run containers on a single host.  | 3. Kubernetes is a cluster (group of nodes) that work together to run and manage containers |
   | 4. Docker lacks features like auto-healing, auto-scaling, and load-balancing  | 4. With K8s Controllers or Horizontal Pod Auto-scaling (HPA), solves the auto-scaling problem on Docker containers |
