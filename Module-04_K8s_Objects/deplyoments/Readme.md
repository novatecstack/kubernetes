# K8s Deployments

## Introduction to K8s Deployments

   - A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
   - You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. 
   - You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.
