# template.spec.volumes — defines a name for the volume, which is referenced below in containers.volumeMounts 

# template.spec.volumes.persistVolumeClaim — references a PVC. For this to work, you must have some PVs in your cluster and create a PVC object that matches those PVs. You can then reference the existing PVC object here and the pod will attempt to bind to a matching PV.
